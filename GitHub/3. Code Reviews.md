## 1. Code reviews

If someone has set you up as a reviewer or you've received an email or GitHub notification, click on the PR you want to review. To review a Pull Request on GitHub, follow these steps:

### 1.1. Review the code

On the PR page, you can see all the **changes** that have been proposed. Here you will find a comparison between the base branch (usually the main branch, such as **`main`** or **`master`**) and the PR branch.

GitHub allows you to make **comments** directly on the modified lines of code. If you find something that needs to be fixed or improved, you can add a specific comment for the PR author to see.

### 1.2. Test the changes

If you have the possibility and the time, it is advisable to test the proposed changes in the PR. You can clone the PR branch on your local machine and run the changes to make sure they work as expected.

### 1.3. Review the conversation

In addition to comments in the code, you can leave **general comments** in the PR conversation. These can be questions, suggestions or approvals, as appropriate.

Keep an eye on the conversation in the PR. The author may respond to your comments or make additional changes in response to your suggestions.

## 2. Merge a `Pull Request` on GitHub

If you're happy with the changes and everything looks OK, you can approve the PR. To do this, select the `Approve` option in the review box.

Once everyone is happy with the changes and the PR has been approved, the author (or a contributor with write permissions) will be able to **merge** the changes into the base branch. This will incorporate the changes from the PR into the main branch of the repository. This can be done in two different ways:

1. **Merge Normal (Merge commit):** By choosing this option, a new merge commit is created which incorporates all the changes from the PR into the base branch. The commit history of the PR is maintained, allowing individual tracking of changes and a transparent review of the development history.
2. **Squash Merge:** With this option, all PR commits are "squashed" into a single commit before merging. The commit history of the PR is removed, and only one new commit with all changes is created. This helps to keep a cleaner and tidier commit history in the main repository branch.

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to maintain clear and respectful communication with the pull request author and other reviewers. The pull request review process is a crucial part of maintaining quality code in a collaborative repository.
