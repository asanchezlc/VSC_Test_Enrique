## 1. Introduction

To create a new repository linked to GitHub there are 2 options:

1. Create the repository on the pc and upload it to GitHub.
2. Create the repository on GitHub and clone it to the pc.

Option 2 is easier, so it is recommended to do it this way (and it is the one explained in this file).

## 2. Steps

The steps are as follows:

1. Open GitHub
2. Click on "New".

3. It is recommended to

- Add README.md file
- Add .gitignore file (look for the default configured for Python)
- Set the private repository**.

4. Click on "Create repository".

5. Clone the repository locally

Go to the folder where you want to clone the repository and right-click to open ``Git Bash` or whatever terminal you use, and run the following:

````bash
git clone <https://github.com/><repository-name>.git
````

This will create a folder with the name of the project, where you can work with integrated Git.
